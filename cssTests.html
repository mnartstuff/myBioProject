                <p>This is an experimental site for me to practice my web-design skills. Since I am stuck at home during this pandemic, and since I am not qualified to teach ESL in my home country, and since I have long been interested in developing my computer skills, I started learning web-design last July. This page is just to practice styling, and I thought it would be funky to have coloured boxes. </p>

            <p class="meText">I'm from the small town of Hancock, NH. It's the kind of place you'd expect to see on a postcard you'd send someone from your New England foliage tour. But I haven't spent my entire life there. At the age of twenty, I moved overseas and spent most of my adult life in Europe, living in France, Spain, England, and the Czech Republic. For close to two years, I've been residing in Saint Paul, Minnesota.</p>

                <p class="nhText">Other than three years in Aberdeen, MD, when I was a young lad, I spent my childhood growing up in the Monadnock region of New Hampshire. It was a great place to grow up, out in the country, surrounded by forest and mountains. I developed a love of skiing, hiking and nature. It's also home to the Hancock Town Library, where my mother helps to organize the annual book sale.

                <h2>The Czech Republic</h2>
                <p class="czText">After Hancock, the place I lived in the longest would be Prague, capital of the Czech Republic. The photo above shows Prague Castle on the hill, and below it the "Mala Strana," or "Lesser Town." I loved the vibrant theatre scene in the Czech Republic, and I was frequently involved in putting on plays with my friends, either acting, building sets, stage-managing or occasionally puppeteering. I also taught languages: English, Spanish and French. Theatre and languages are two passions of mine. I also used to visit friends in Moravia, in the Eastern part of the country. South Moravia is wine country, and occasionally I got to help my friends tend their vinyards.</p>

It's a city of around 100,000 on the Doubs river, just north-west of Switzerland. A fortified city since pre-Roman times, most of the well-preserved old town is part of the massive seventeenth-century fortifications built during the Thirty-Years War and designed by the military architect, Vauban. I loved the atmosphere there. It was the kind of city where the cafes all had well-used chess sets ready, and musicians would wander in a play jazz on the piano in the corner.</p>

I didn't realize at the time that I wouldn't be moving back to my home country for another eighteen years. After working a half year for the British National Health Service (which, for all its faults, I hope the country fights to save), I enrolled in university in Nottingham to study French and Spanish. The third of my four years at Nottingham Trent University, I divided between France and Spain, at the univeristies of Strasbourg and Le&oacute;n.</p>

It's a small, family-style business of people who love old ouses and like working on them. It was fun to learn, not just ainting, but the holistic approach to preservation that the company takes. Just as fun are the spirited discussions and debates on everything from philosophy to history to folklore to basketball that regularly take place among this erudite group of craftspeople. For the past six months, thanks in no small part to the Coronavirus pandemic, I have been learning web design, which is why you are reading this now.</p>
